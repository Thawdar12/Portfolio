                <h3>Problems and Thought Process:</h3>

                <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>User Security:</strong> Making sure security didnâ€™t get in the way of a smooth user experience was key! 
                            We added <strong>MFA, AES encryption, and tokenization</strong> to protect data while keeping things easy to use, 
                            plus a <strong>Fraud Detection system</strong> to stop bad actors.</li>     
                        <li><strong>Performance & Scalability:</strong> We needed to keep things fast even when lots of transactions were happening. 
                            <strong>Redundancy</strong>, and <strong>microservices</strong> helped us manage the traffic and stay responsive</li>  
                        <li><strong>Data Privacy:</strong> Protecting user info was a must! We followed strict standards like <strong>PCI DSS</strong> 
                            and <strong>GDPR</strong> to keep everything encrypted and secure.</li> 
  
                    </ul>
                </p>
        
              
                <h3>What I Learned:</h3>
                <p>        
                    On OnePay, I honed my skills in <strong>advanced security measures</strong> like <strong>AES-256 encryption, MFA, and tokenization</strong>, 
                    while also developing a custom <strong>Fraud Detection system</strong>. 
                    I worked with cloud services like <strong>AliCloud</strong>, and used <strong>Node.js, SpringBoot, and MySQL/PostgreSQL</strong> to build a fast, 
                    scalable backend. 
                    To ensure high availability, I implemented <strong>microservices</strong> for optimal performance. 
                    I also gained valuable experience in <strong>risk management</strong> by focusing on <strong>firewalls, penetration testing,</strong> 
                    and ensuring <strong>data privacy</strong> compliance. Throughout the project, I followed <strong>Agile</strong> practices to continuously refine and improve the platform.
