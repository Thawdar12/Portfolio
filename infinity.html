                <h3>Project Description</h3>
                <p>
                    Infinity Network is a vibrant platform I built for buying, selling, and reviewing used cars.
                    With roles for admins, agents, sellers, and buyers, everyone has a unique experience. 
                    Agents manage car listings, buyers browse, save, and rate cars, sellers list their vehicles, and admins oversee everything. 
                    <br>
                    It's a fun, interactive way to navigate the used car market!
                </p>
                <h3>Project Purpose and Goal</h3>
                <p>
                    Infinity Network was built to simplify the buying and selling process while enhancing the experience. 
                    By supporting multiple user roles, the platform helps users connect easily, make informed decisions, 
                    and enjoy a secure, personalized shopping experience. 
                    <strong> 
                        Our goal is to streamline transactions with ratings, reviews, and personalized recommendations.
                    </strong>

                <h3>Problems and Thought Process</h3>

                <p>
                    While building Infinity Network, I faced a few tricky challenges but came up with some creative solutions:
                <p>
                    <strong>User Role Management:</strong>
                    Managing different roles (admins, agents, buyers, sellers) was crucial. 
                    I built <strong>Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)</strong> to ensure users could only access what 
                    they neededâ€”admins handled everything, while buyers and sellers had limited access.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Privacy & Security:</strong>
                    Keeping data secure was a priority! I focused on storing only essential info (like emails) and 
                    added <strong>secure authentication</strong> to prevent unauthorized access.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Performance Optimization:</strong>
                    With lots of users, I optimized backend queries and used <strong>Nginx</strong> for load balancing, ensuring smooth performance even during high traffic.    
                </p>
        
              
                <h3>What I Learned</h3>
                <p>        
                    As the Backend Developer and Team Leader, I gained leadership skills by managing communication and resolving conflicts within the team. 
                    My technical expertise in <strong>Java</strong> and <strong>Spring Boot</strong> grew as I worked through complex backend logic and API integrations. 
                    Collaborating with frontend developers gave me <strong>a broader understanding of full-stack development</strong>, 
                    and I learned how to align backend functionality with user interface design. The experience with <strong>Test-Driven Development (TDD)</strong> taught me 
                    the importance of writing tests early to minimize bugs. By following <strong>Agile and Scrum</strong> methodologies, I learned to adapt quickly based on feedback. 
                    Additionally, I gained practical experience with <strong>cloud deployment and CI/CD pipelines</strong>, streamlining the development and delivery process for error-free releases.
