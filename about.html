                <h2 class="about-h2">Ever since I was 10, technology had me hooked!</h2>
                <p>
                    Back then, it was all about the thrill of playing games, watching videos, and scrolling endlessly 
                    through social media. But things got really interesting when my mom and uncle—both tech enthusiasts—started 
                    sharing behind-the-scenes stories of how these platforms were built. The thrill of success when something 
                    worked and the frustration of solving tough problems? <strong>That completely fascinated me!</strong>
                </p>
        
                <p>
                    Suddenly, I wasn’t just playing games anymore; 
                    <br>
                    <span style="padding-left: 50px;">I was thinking,</span> 
                    <span class="about-highlight">“How do they actually build this stuff?”</span>
                </p>
        
                <p>
                    As soon as I finished high school, I dove headfirst into the tech world. It’s been an exciting ride—countless 
                    hours of learning, experimenting, coding, and figuring out how things work under the hood. 
                    <strong>Through this hands-on journey, I discovered what excites me most: developing secure, reliable software.</strong>
                </p>
        
                <p>
                    There’s something deeply rewarding about building systems that people can depend on, and that’s what drives 
                    <strong>my passion for software development today.</strong>
                </p>
                <h3>As a developer</h3>
                <p>        
                    I build my life—and my code—around core values: 
                    <strong> honesty, fairness, and perseverance.</strong> 
                    Whether it’s tackling bugs or life’s challenges, I stay committed, no matter how tough things get.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During my final year project, I faced a persistent bug that took weeks to resolve. It was frustrating, 
                    but I kept testing and learning until I finally cracked it. 
                    That experience reinforced my belief that persistence always pays off.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>I value collaboration and respect, </strong> 
                    making it a priority to follow through on commitments and build trust with others—just like writing clean, 
                    maintainable code that others can rely on.

                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>I also carry a positive mindset into everything I do. </strong>
                    When things don’t go as planned, I see it as a chance to learn and improve. 
                    It’s this attitude that helped me overcome obstacles during my studies and continues to guide me today.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These values define how I work and live, and I’m eager to keep growing with them as my foundation.
                </p>

                <h3>
                    As a person
                </h3>
                <p>
                    I love spreading <strong>Humor</strong>—whether it’s through a quick joke or just making someone smile. 
                    Code bugs are serious, but life doesn’t have to be!
                </p>
                <p>
                    With <strong>Bravery</strong>, I face challenges head-on. 
                    Whether it’s standing up for what’s right or tackling a tough problem, I don’t back down.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I’m powered by <strong>Curiosity</strong> and <strong>Humility</strong>, always eager to learn something new—whether 
                    it’s a cool tech stack or a better way to solve a problem. 
                    I stay grounded, knowing there’s always more to discover in the ever-evolving world.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These traits make life an exciting adventure—full of learning, laughing, and growing.
