                <h3>Project Description</h3>
                <p>
                    I worked on building an intuitive mobile app for selling furnitureâ€”an Android-based e-commerce platform. 
                    The main focus was crafting a smooth, <strong>user-friendly interface</strong> using <strong>Flutter</strong>, 
                    while collaborating closely with <strong>backend developers</strong> to make sure everything ran seamlessly. 
                    Plus, I <strong>kept stakeholders in the loop</strong> with regular updates, ensuring the app met their vision and expectations.
                </p>
                <h3>Project Purpose and Goal</h3>
                <p>
                    The goal was simple: create a furniture shopping app that's super easy to use and fun to navigate! 
                    By integrating <strong>third-party APIs</strong> and fine-tuning <strong>database performance</strong>, 
                    we wanted to make sure users could browse, shop, and check out with ease while keeping everything smooth and scalable in the backend.

                <h3>Web Stack and Explanation</h3>
                
                <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Backend:</strong> Powered by <strong>Odoo</strong> for all things e-commerce                        </li>     
                        <li><strong>Database:</strong> <strong>MySQL</strong> to manage products and user data  </li>  
                        <li><strong>Frontend:</strong> Built with <strong>Flutter</strong> for a beautiful, responsive mobile app</li> 
                        <li><strong>Tools:</strong> <strong>Visual Studio Code, Postman, and GitHub</strong> for development and teamwork </li>
                            
                    </ul>
                </p>

                
                <h3>Problems and Thought Process</h3>

                <p>
                    The biggest challenge? I was new to <strong>Flutter</strong>, but I dove in headfirst and quickly got the hang of it! 
                    I spent a lot of time crafting that perfect, intuitive experience for users. 
                    I also worked hand-in-hand with the backend team to ensure <strong>seamless data flow and smooth API integration</strong>. 
                    On top of that, I regularly checked in with stakeholders, making sure they were happy with progress and kept aligned with their vision for the app.
                </p>        
              
                <h3>What I Learned</h3>
                <p>        
                    I got to play with <strong>Flutter</strong> and <strong>Odoo</strong>, becoming way more comfortable with both. 
                    I learned the art of creating <strong>engaging interfaces</strong> that make users want to stick around. 
                    I also improved my <strong>communication skills</strong> by keeping stakeholders involved every step of the way, 
                    making sure their feedback shaped the app. Along the way, I picked up valuable insights into <strong>database optimization</strong>, 
                    <strong>third-party API integration</strong>, and building a system that scales as it grows.
